                As the shadows were awakening and a scent of the morning was carried with the mist, I saw a hawk decending from the mountain top.
                Without a flutter of the wings it slid through the air above me and then disappeared among the trees that rimed the valley.
            </p>
            <p>
                It left me standing there, the head in my neck, all gaze up to the grey clouds where it disappeared, hoping for it to return.
            </p>
            <p>
                It didn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hawk wasn't me.
