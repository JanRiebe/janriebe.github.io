            Thirty thousant years from now, when earth looks the same viewed from Jupiter and Moon and unrecognisably different from human eyes, they stand in museums imagining us.
            <br>They look at a car key dropped in a river, ski glasses of a mummy found frozen in ice, photographs of instriptions found in a deep cave, reading in yet to be deciphered glyphes "I was here".
            <br>Most marks of our existence are gone or unrecognisable, curiosities, which leave people wonder whether we too felt that it was now and that what we did mattered to the universe.
            <br>A new ancient site is found, archeological news. It appears to be a hidden chaimber deep underground, sealed thick in concrete and metal. Scattered around inscriptions have been found and icons engraved deep in stone, sculls, crosses and other warnings that prove that this must be an exciting find.
            <br>Thirty thousant years from now, they had not yet discovered radio active decay.
