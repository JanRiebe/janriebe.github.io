Roadmap js tile rpg engine

Goal:
	A simple rpg engine that allows building games and runs them from text files
	
Features:
	Scripting that is like screenwriting
		definitions at beginning of scene
		map is like this 1 0 1 1 0 0 2 3
		character x is at tile 12 32
		church is at tile 12 32
		character x says y gives you z takes a moves to church
		when character b sees you
			character b says c
		when you talk to character d
			if you have e
				character d says f
			else
				character d says g
				
				
Architecture:
	Events
		Events can be triggered
		They change the game state
			Player location
			active map
			dialog
			NPC actions
			player inventory changes
			global game flag changes
		They can trigger other events based on conditions
		


TODO:
	Allow drawing tiles from second row of map
	Allow drawing tiles from other maps
	
	Character drawing and animation
	Also animation for tiles
	
	Background and foreground tiles
	
	Separate collision
	Triggers
	perhaps make maps into objects
	
	Dialog
	
	NPCs
	
	Item menu
	
	Trading
	
	Fighting???
	
	Think about overall game event flow
		what is a scene?
		what does trigger a scene?
		can you replay scenes?
		what happens if you leave and reenter a scene?
			do scenes have states that are saved?
		would be cool ig elements in a scene could be different, depending on whether you interacted with them
			do they have a separate state?
