        So, I'm thinking of starting a blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wondering whether to use some blogging tool or do it just in html.
        Maybe I just start in html and then see how it goes.
        Might teach me some html on the fly.
        Though I do want to focus on content here.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to blog about my projects.
        A little bit of promotion but mainly showcasing process and thoughts behind it.
        My projects are stories, which I write, playful coding and the occasional game, where I try to combine both.
        I also dabble in music. Let's see whether I blog about that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another topic is what language to blog in.
        I speak German and English.
        I might do it depending on topic.
        Nobody should be scared away by the language.
        Perhaps I can even write most posts in two languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope this adds some value to the internet.
