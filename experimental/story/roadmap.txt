##########   Design   ##########

Workflows:
    I add an idea >> I tag my ideas so that they are organised >> I add the idea content to my knowledgebase as a character, a place, a prop or whatever >> I mark the idea as implemented and it gets hidden.
    I write into the blue and end up with a scene >> It automatically looks up all the characters in that scene and shows them to me >> I can write information from that scene that might be relevant later to the character >> I also tag beats from existing arcs
    I plan a scene >> For each character I write down information >> I also mark which plot archs are affected and whether something is set up, payed off, a turn ect.
    I plan an arch >> I write down a premise >> Then I lay out the beats of the arch and specify whether they are setup, payoff, question, answer or whatever



Data
    Ideas
        A piece of text, with tags and links to dictionary entryies and scenes
    Dictionary Entry
        Character
            A name, a description, other information, multiple motivations (and other texts) that are linked to scenes
        Place
            A name, a description, a map
        Prop
        Map
            svg data, locations that are links to dictionary entries
        Timeline
            multiple versions of the same type of dictionary entry that changes over time, each entry can have links to scenes
        ect.
    Arc
        A premise text and a list of beats
    Beat
        A piece of text with a beat type and relationships to other beats, such as question and answer, setup and payoff
        A beat belongs to one arc.
    Plot beat
        One or more arc beats which happen at the same story time
        (For example can something at the same time resolve one arc and start a new one.) 
    Plot
        A list of plot beats
    Scene
        A piece of text with a title/premise, a collection of links to ideas and dictionary entries, timeline steps


    Wordcount
        When writing I want to see the word count.
        I want to set a daily goal and see on what days I wrote how much.
        
        
TODO

    Plot view
        think about what layout would be good for plotting
            plotting arcs
            plotting scenes

    writing view
        Filter scene information using filter

        Have the different views on different pages
            This way I don't have to collapse things all the time
