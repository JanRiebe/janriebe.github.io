    <h1>blogs are about communicating</h1>
    <span>16.07.2020</span>
    <p>
        When I say I want to blog, why do I want to blog?
    </p>
    <p>
        There could be plenty of reasons to blog, showing off, reflecting my own thoughts, advertising whatever I feel is worth advertising, connecting with other people. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think I want to communicate. I want talk with other people about, being part of the greater discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I think there is actually already too much discussion going on. So why contribute? 
      And why use a blog like this, which is very much a one way street of communication. 
      Why not twitter? Why not have a commenting function?
    </p>
    <p>
        I do this instead of twitter, because this is for slower things. Twitter is fast, it's about what is happening now.
      I want these blog posts resemble a piece of writing rather than a shout into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm terribly afraid that I will be judged "in real life" by what I write here.
      But I think this is part of communicating. You say something. Someone thinks you are an idiot for saying it. Someone thinks you naive or unprofessional.
      It's being out there. When you step on the street, people will look at you.
      All part of the excersise.
    </p>    
    <p>
        So what do I want to contribute to the discussion?
      Just me. Words that I write. The greater discussion maybe can be a greater conversation.
      People just hanging out in the same staircase while two house parties collide. People waiting for the bus.
      It's not that bad to talk about the weather.

    <h1>thinking of starting a blog</h1>
    <span>08.07.2020</span>
    <p>
        So, I'm thinking of starting a blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wondering whether to use some blogging tool or do it just in html.
        Maybe I just start in html and then see how it goes.
        Might teach me some html on the fly.
        Though I do want to focus on content here.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to blog about my projects.
        A little bit of promotion but mainly showcasing process and thoughts behind it.
        My projects are stories, which I write, playful coding and the occasional game, where I try to combine both.
        I also dabble in music. Let's see whether I blog about that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another topic is what language to blog in.
        I speak German and English.
        I might do it depending on topic.
        Nobody should be scared away by the language.
        Perhaps I can even write most posts in two languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope this adds some value to the internet.
